# Overview

*excerpt from http://www.postgresql.org/about/*

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.  It
has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has
earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.
It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views,
triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most
SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE,
INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP.  It also supports storage of binary large objects,
including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for
C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and
[exceptional documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/).

An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as
Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces,
asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups,
a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault
tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character
encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and
formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can
manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.  There are
active PostgreSQL systems in production environments that manage in excess of 4
terabytes of data.

# Usage

This charm can deploy a single standalone PostgreSQL unit, or a service
containing a single master unit and one or more replicas.

To setup a single 'standalone' service:

    juju deploy postgresql pg-a


## Scale Out Usage

To add a replica to an existing service:

    juju add-unit pg-a

To deploy a new service containing a master and two hot standby replicas:

    juju deploy -n 3 postgresql pg-b

You can remove units as normal. If the master unit is removed, failover occurs
and the most up to date hot standby is promoted to the master.  The
'db-relation-changed' and 'db-admin-relation-changed' hooks are fired,
letting clients adjust:

    juju remove-unit pg-b/0


To setup a client using a PostgreSQL database, in this case a vanilla Django
installation listening on port 8080:

    juju deploy postgresql
    juju deploy python-django
    juju deploy gunicorn
    juju add-relation python-django postgresql:db
    juju add-relation python-django gunicorn
    juju expose python-django


# Interacting with the Postgresql Service

## Client Charms

Python client charms should be composed using `interface:pgsql`, which
provides an easy way of navigating the complexities of the client
interface. See http://interface-pgsql.readthedocs.io for details.

The PostgreSQL charm provides two client relations. The `db` relation
provides a normal account to the requested database. The database
may be shared with other Juju Applications, allowing data to be shared.
The `db-admin` relation provides administrative access to all databases
on the PostgreSQL units.

Note that due to the asynchronous nature of Juju and the relation model,
you may be provided connection strings to PostgreSQL units that are not
yet ready to accept connections from your client. Your charm and application
should handle connection failures and retry later, like it would any other
network outage.


### Non-Python Client Charms

Your charm may optionally set the following attributes on the `db`
and `db-admin` relations in the relation-joined hook:

* `database` - The requested database name
* `roles` - A comma separated list of PostgreSQL roles to grant this
  relation's user. Roles will be created if they do not already exist.
* `extensions` - A comma separated list of PostgreSQL extensions to install
  into the requested database.

The PostgreSQL units will eventually provide the following attributes on
the `db` and `db-admin` relations:

* `master` - The libpq connection string to the master database
* `standbys` - A newline separted list of libpq connection strings to
  the standby databases. This will be empty if there is only a single
  master unit.


## Database Permissions and Disaster Recovery

âš  These two topics are entwined, because failing to follow best
  practice with your database permissions will make your life difficult
  when you need to recover after failure.

PostgreSQL has comprehensive database security, including ownership
and permissions on database objects. By default, any objects a client
service creates will be owned by a user with the same name as the
client service and inaccessible to other users. To share data, it
is best to create new roles, grant the relevant permissions and object
ownership to the new roles and finally grant these roles to the users
your services can connect as. This also makes disaster recovery easier.
If you restore a database into an indentical Juju environment, then
the service names and usernames will be the same and database permissions
will match. However, if you restore a database into an environment
with different client service names then the usernames will not match
and the new users not have access to your data.

Learn about the SQL `GRANT` statement in the excellect [PostgreSQL
reference guide][3].


### block-storage-broker

If you are using external storage provided by the block storage broker,
recovery or a failed unit is simply a matter of ensuring the old unit
is fully shut down, and then bringing up a fresh unit with the old
external storage mounted. The charm will see the old database there
and use it.

If you are unable or do not wish to to simply remount the same
filesystem, you can of course copy all the data from the old filesystem
to the new one before bringing up the new unit.

### dump/restore

PostgreSQL dumps, such as those that can be scheduled in the charm, can
be recovered on a new unit by using 'juju ssh' to connect to the new unit
and using the standard PostgreSQL `pg_restore(1)` tool. This new unit must
be standalone, or the master unit. Any hot standbys will replicate the
recovered data from the master.

You will need to use `pg_restore(1)` with the `--no-owner` option, as
users that existed in the old service will not exist in the new
service.

### PITR

If you had configured WAL-E, you can recover a WAL-E backup and replay
to a point in time of your choosing using the `wal-e` tool. This
will recover the whole database cluster, so all databases will be
replaced.

If there are any hot standby units, they will need to be destroyed
and recreated after the PITR recovery.


# Point In Time Recovery

The PostgreSQL charm has support for log shipping and point in time
recovery. This feature uses the wal-e[2] tool, which will be
installed from the Launchpad PPA ppa:stub/pgcharm. This feature
requires access to either Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Block Storage or
Swift. This feature is experimental because it has only been tested with
Swift. The charm can be configured to perform regular filesystem backups
and ship WAL files to the object store. Hot standbys will make use of
the archived WAL files, allowing them to resync after extended netsplits
or even let you turn off streaming replication entirely.

With a base backup and the WAL archive you can perform point in time
recovery, but this is still a manual process and the charm does not
yet help you do it. The simplest approach would be to create a new
PostgreSQL service containing a single unit, 'juju ssh' in and use
wal-e to replace the database after shutting it down, create a
recovery.conf to replay the archived WAL files using wal-e, restart the
database and wait for it to recover. Once recovered, new hot standby
units can be added and client services related to the new database
service.

To enable the experimental wal-e support with Swift, you will need to
and set the service configuration settings similar to the following:

    postgresql:
        wal_e_storage_uri: swift://mycontainer
        os_username: my_swift_username
        os_password: my_swift_password
        os_auth_url: https://keystone.auth.url.example.com:8080/v2/
        os_tenant_name: my_tenant_name
        install_sources: |
            - ppa:stub/pgcharm
            - cloud:icehouse
        install_keys: |
            - null
            - null


# Development and Contributions

The PostgreSQL Charm is maintained on Launchpad[4] using git. The 'master'
branch is a Reactive Framework Layer, and generates a deployable Charm
using the 'charm build' command provided by charm-tools.

The latest stable source layer is in the 'master' branch in the
git+ssh://git.launchpad.net/postgresql-charm repository. Merge proposals
should be made against the 'master' branch. Do not make merge proposals
against the old Bazaar branches or the 'built' branch.


# Support

Bug reports can be made at https://bugs.launchpad.net/postgresql-charm.
Queries can be made in any of the major Juju forums, such as the main
Juju mailing list or the #juju channel on Freenode IRC.


## Latest Stable

The latest tested, stable release of this charm can be found at
https://jujucharms.com/postgresql/ and deployed with juju using the
URI `cs:postgresql`. It is also available as the 'built' git branch
in the git+ssh://git.launchpad.net/postgresql-charm repository:

    mkdir trusty
    git clone -b built \
        https://git.launchpad.net/postgresql-charm trusty/postgresql
    JUJU_REPOSITORY=. juju deploy local:postgresql
