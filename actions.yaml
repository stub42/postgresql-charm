maintenance-mode-start:
  description: >
    Put the cluster into maintenance mode, where Juju hooks will
    do nothing and the charm will make no changes to the deployment.
    This action must be run on the Juju leader. It is your responsibility
    to ensure that any manual maintenance work you perform will not
    confuse the charm and it will regain control once maintenance mode is
    ended. Turning off mainenance mode after significant changes, such as
    a manual failover, can result in catastrophic dataloss. It is also
    important to not instruct Juju to make changes during maintenance
    mode, such as adding storage to units or upgrading the charm, as
    the charm will not react to these changes and the operations can
    also result in catestrophic dataloss when required preamble steps
    are not performed.
