# This file is installed into /etc/rsyslog.d to forward the unit's
# PostgreSQL logs via syslog to another service.

# This configuration is pretty dumb, and was cargo culted from the
# rsyslog-forwarder charm. The client really needs to inform the
# server what sort of service it requires (eg. reliability), but that
# involves extending and documenting the juju common syslog interface.
