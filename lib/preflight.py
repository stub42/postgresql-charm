    Decorator to run a handler before the main hook phase.

    preflight hooks are used to initialize state for use by the
    main hooks (including hooks that exist in other layers). They
    can also be used to validate the environment, blocking the unit
    and aborting the hook if something this layer is responsible for
    is broken (eg. a service configuration option set to an invalid
    value). We need abort before the main reactive loop, or we
    risk failing to run handlers that rely on @when_file_changed,
    reactive.helpers.data_changed or other state tied to
    charmhelpers.core.unitdata transactions.
