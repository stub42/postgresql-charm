      The IP addresses added here will be included in the pg_hba.conf file 
      allowing ip connections to all databases on the server from the given

    description: |
        The command to run whenever config has changed. Accepted values
        are "reload" or "restart" - any other value will mean neither is
        executed after a config change (which may be desired, if you're
        running a production server and would rather handle these out of
        band). Note that postgresql will still need to be reloaded
        whenever authentication and access details are updated, so
        disabling either doesn't mean PostgreSQL will never be reloaded.

        Hot standby or warm standby. When True, queries can be run against
        the database when in recovery or standby mode (ie. replicated).
        Overridden by juju when master/slave relations are used.
  hot_standby_feedback:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
        Hot standby feedback, informing a master about in progress
        transactions on a streaming hot standby and allowing the master to
        defer cleanup and avoid query cancelations on the hot standby.
  wal_level:
    default: minimal
    type: string
    description: |
        'minimal', 'archive' or 'hot_standby'. Defines how much information
        is written to the WAL. Set to 'minimal' for stand alone databases

  max_wal_senders:

    type: int
    description: |
        Number of old WAL files to keep, providing a larger buffer for
        streaming hot standbys to catch up from when lagged. Each WAL file
        is 16MB in size. The WAL files are the buffer of how far a
        hot standby can lag behind the master, and replication fails if
        this buffer is overrun. When this service is replicated, the larger
        value of wal_keep_segments and replicated_wal_keep_segments is used.
  replicated_wal_keep_segments:
    default: 5000
    type: int
    description: |
        Value of wal_keep_segments used when this service is replicated.
        This setting only exists to provide a sane default when replication

        Possible values here are "manual", "DW" (data warehouse),
        "OLTP" (online transaction processing), "Web" (web application),
        "Desktop" or "Mixed". When this is set to a value other than
        "manual", the charm invokes the pgtune tool to tune a number
        of performance parameters based on the specified load type.
        pgtune gathers information about the node on which you are deployed and
        tries to make intelligent guesses about what tuning parameters to set
        based on available RAM and CPU under the assumption that it's the only
        significant service running on this node.

    type: string
    description: |
        Effective cache size is an estimate of how much memory is available for
        disk caching within the database. (50% to 75% of system memory). This

  extra_pg_auth:

    description: |
        A comma separated extra pg_hba.conf auth rules.
        This will be written to the pg_hba.conf file, one line per rule.
        Note that this should not be needed as db relations already create
        those rules the right way. Only use this if you really need too

        Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
        A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
        in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
            juju-postgresql-0
        If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
        this allows you to differentiate between them.

    description: |
      EXPERIMENTAL.
      Number of recent base backups to retain. You need enough space in

      be removed after a new one has been successfully made to replace it.
  swiftwal_log_shipping:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      EXPERIMENTAL.
      Archive WAL files into Swift. If swiftwal_backup_schedule is set,
      this allows point-in-time recovery and WAL files are removed
      automatically with old backups. If swiftwal_backup_schedule is not set

  streaming_replication:
